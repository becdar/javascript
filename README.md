* **trivia.js**
While working my way through Treehouse's Rail Development track, I was required to take the JavaScript basics course. One of the projects was to create a trivia game, but the game always asked the same three questions. I thought it would be more fun to choose the questions randomnly from a large pool of questions so that users don't have the same questions each time.  This file prompts the user with three questions selected randomnly from the array of question objects and assigns them a score based on their answers.
